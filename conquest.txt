CONQUEST SYNOPSIS

	Here's an extract from the conquest.doc file:

          NAME
               Conquest  -  a multi-player real-time screen-oriented space
               war game

          SYNOPSIS
               conquest

          DESCRIPTION


               1. OBJECT OF THE GAME.

               The object of the game is twofold. The  short-range  goal
               is  to accumulate "kills" by shooting down enemy players.
               You get one kill point for each  enemy  ship  shot  down,
               plus  some  extra  if  the enemy had kills too. The major
               weapon used to shoot down ships is the photon torpedo.

               The long-range goal is to conquer the universe  for  your
               team  by taking every planet. You take planets by killing
               off the enemy's armies via bombardment, and then  beaming
               your  team's  armies down. When all the planets have been
               taken, the game ends, a new game begins, and  the  player
               who  actually  took  the last planet gets his/her name up
               in lights.

               ...
