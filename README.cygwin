        This document lists the requirements and additional
        procedures for compiling and installing Conquest 8.0.1+ under
        Cygwin ( www.cygwin.com ) for MS Windows systems.

        - When installing Cygwin, make sure you also install the
          following packages:

            ncurses
            bison
            flex
            crypt


            For the OpenGL client (conquestgl), you will need the X11
            (xorg-x11-*), Mesa (opengl), and GLUT packages
            (runtime and development) installed.

            xorg-*
            opengl
            freeglut

            these are in addition to the development packages (gcc,
            etc) of course. 

        - before compiling Conquest, make sure that IPC services are
          available.  In newer cygwins (8/5/2006), ipc services are
          handled by the 'cygserver' process (installed by default)
          rather than the now obsoleted cygipc package.  This program
          must also be running before starting any Conquest
          executables.

          According the the README's, after installing cygwin, run:

          $ /bin/cygserver-config 

          to configure the service.  Select 'y' when asked if the
          cygserver process should be installed as a service.

          Then start it:

          $ net start cygserver

          Next, for IPC services to be available to a process, the
          word 'server' must be present in your CYGWIN environmant
          variable.  I have no idea why, but that's what the doc's
          say, and that's what I did :)

          This can be done in your /etc/profile, .bashrc or other startup
          script as:

          export CYGWIN="$CYGWIN server"

        - When compiling conquest, you should specify a group to
          configure, like:

          ./configure --with-counquest-group=<group name>

          The default is to use group 'Users' which may not exist
          in your locale (for example, in Germany, this group is
          'Benutzer').

          Use 

          cat /etc/groups

          in a Cygwin shell to see what groups you currently have
          available.

          Group ownership is used on unix/linux to prevent cheating -
          this isn't really an issue on Windows, since it is not
          likely ever going to be providing shell access to internet
          users.  It's really just a formality on Windows systems, and
          conqoper will not pay attention to this on Cygwin systems
          anyway. 

        - by default, Conquest will want to install all of it's
          exectuables and data files in the /opt hierarchy.  You can
          change this of course with the '--prefix=' option to
          'configure'.  If you elect to go with the default of /opt,
          make sure you add the path to the executables to your
          shell's PATH variable.  For example:

          edit /etc/profile, and add the following near the bottom:

          export PATH="$PATH:/opt/bin"

        - If you want line drawing to work properly, also add the
          following to /etc/profile:

          export CYGWIN="$CYGWIN codepage:oem"

        - Instructions for compiling, installing, and running Conquest
          are the same as unix otherwise.  See the INSTALL, and README
          files for more information.

        - The Cygwin console seems to work best for playing Conquest.
          I have messed with rxvt, but it's color assignments don't
          match what Conquest expects (via curses).  As a result, if
          you prefer a black background, which Conquest does, Some
          text won't be displayed properly (as it's black instead of
          the white it should be').

          Curses color does appear to work correctly in the cygwin
          consoles. 

          I have not figured out how to get the functions keys to work
          (for macros).  If someone knows the magic, let me know it
          too :)


        To run the OpenGL client, you will need to run it from within
        an X11 session.  Any easy way at the cygwin console is:

        xinit &

        From within X, open up an xterm and just run 'conquestgl' with
        appropriate options.

        Note, unfortunately the OpenGL rendering available in cygwin
        is software (mesa) only.  So it may be too slow to be worth
        using :(  On a P4/3.2Ghz with the vbg off, I can get about 15
        fps at the default resolution.

        Thanks to Sean for trying out the original cygwin version,
        providing some valuable feedback, and most of the original
        content of this document.
