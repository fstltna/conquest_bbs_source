<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>

<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<P>

This manual page documents briefly the 
<B>conqstrat</B> command. 
<P>

<B>conqstrat</B> is a utility which reads rules from stdin to update
Robot strategy tables.  It's normal use is to update the common block
(the game's current 'state') with a 'compiled' robot AI state,
defined by a file such as <I>conqrule</I>. 
<P>

If you want to modify the robot's AI, you can do so and use
<B>conqstrat</B> to either update the common block (running game) with
the new AI directly, or generate a conqdata.h file that can be compiled into
Conquest and used as the default when the universe is initialized. 
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS </H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-v</B>         <DD>
Be verbose about everything. 
<DT><B>-d</B>         <DD>
Turn on lots of debugging. 
<DT><B>-U</B>         <DD>
Update the common block directly.  This is the most common use for
non-conquest developers.  NOTE: If you then use <I>conqoper</I> to
initialize the common block, your AI will be lost and replaced with the
compiled-in default, so you will need to re-run this command to
re-install your own AI again.
<DT><B>-o </B><I>file</I>         <DD>
Output to <I>file</I>.  Without this 
option, output will go to stdout.  The normal use of this option is to
generate a header file that is compiled directly into conquest
(<I>conqdata.h</I>).

<P>

See the <I>conqrule</I> and <I>conqrule.easy</I> files for two robot
strategies supplied in the conquest distribution, and installed in
&lt;install_prefix&gt;/share/doc/conquest/.  <I>conqrule</I> is the original
AI (with minor fixes) supplied in the original VAX/VMS conquest
distribution.  It is also the default AI compiled into Conquest.
<I>conqrule.easy</I> is an AI that is a bit easier on new players :)
You can install it in an initialized game with <I>conqstrat -U
&lt;conqrule.easy</I>.
