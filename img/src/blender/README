This dir contains the blender source files used to render the ships
(well, some of them anyway).  To rerender a ship (re create a ship
texture), load it into blender, Press F12 to render the scene, then F3
to save the rendering.  Make sure the rendering (F10) setup specifies
that renders are to be saved in .tga (Targa) format.

You may need to re load the tga in gimp and resave it to ensure that
RLE compression is used, and that the Origin is specified as the lower
left. 

I am really a *very* beginning blender user.  When you load up one of
these, you will find the ship model, a camera and a light source.  

If you look at the ship models, you'll note I only painted/textured
the top half of the models, as that is all you can see in conquestgl
anyway :)

Ideally, all of the ship textures in conquest would be rendered this
way.  In time I will move over to doing this.  The orion and romulan
ships need the most love.  The feds seem to be in the best shape,
though I imagine there are some models out there somewhere that could
be used to re-render them for 'completeness' :)
