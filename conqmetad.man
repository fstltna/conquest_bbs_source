.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBconqmetad\fP [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBconqmetad\fP is a meta server for Conquest.  A meta server listens
for game availablity announcements from other \fBconquestd\fP servers
scattered about, and makes this list available to conquest clients that use the
\fB\-m\fP option.  This makes it easy for people to find prospective
games. 
.PP
The de-facto Conquest Meta server runs at \fBconquest.radscan.com\fP.
.PP
The meta server listens on port UDP port 1700 for announcements from
\fBconquestd\fP servers.  TCP connections to port 1700 cause
\fBconqmetad\fP to dump the current server list and their associated
data in an easily parsable text format, one server per line, and
disconnect.
