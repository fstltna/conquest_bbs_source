.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBconqdriv\fP is a process that is automatically started and stopped
by the conquest server \fBconquestd\fP as needed.  It is used to drive
the universe, and should not be started by ordinary users.  Management
of the \fBconqdriv\fP process is automatically handled by
\fBconquestd\fP as needed.
.PP
When run with the \fB\-f\fP option, \fBconqdriv\fP will cause any
currently running \fBconqdriv\fP process to terminate, and then take
control of the universe directly.  This option is only of use to
developers for debugging purposes.
