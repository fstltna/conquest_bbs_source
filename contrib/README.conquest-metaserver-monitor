For the record, here is an improved AWK script that accepts some
variables via the command line.

I use it like this in my crontab:

@hourly    ~/bin/scripts/conquest-metaserver-monitor -v email=matt,tamarella

But you can also specify an optional metaserver name & port number
using additional -v arguments.


Hope someone finds this useful,

Matt


[Jon - note, this script required GNU AWK (gawk)]
